Traditional #algorithm:
- Finite
- Definite
- Effective
- Procedure (steps)

Solve a problem: a function $f$ For each input -> Correct output

AI is different: **heuristic programming**

Time complexity: $T(n)$, with $n$ being the *input size*
\# steps token by algorithm to implement $f$
- Worst case analysis
- Average case analysis
The graph time-per-input-size is almost-always non-decreasing

If there are two algorithms, one faster at input size $i$ where $0≤i≤n$, and the other where $n≤i≤+∞$, the best algorithm is an algorithm that chooses the better algorithm depending on size.
